# quantum-programming-platform
This repository consist of codes and data used in the journal article "Advantages of Two Quantum Programming Platforms Advantage in Quantum Computing and Quantum Chemistry".

Installation of Qiskit and PennyLane are necessary for their usage.
Other libraries required in the usage examples will be stated in this document.

# Generation of Figure 1 & 2

# Generation of Figure 5 & 6

# Usage Example: Half Adder

# Usage Example: Machine Learning
Required libraries: qiskit_algorithms, qiskit_machine_learning, sklearn

The data used to build the models is the famous iris dataset, which can be loaded from sklearn.datasets.
The codes to build Qiskit is .py.
